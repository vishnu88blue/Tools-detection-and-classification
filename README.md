# Tools-detection-and-classification
This repository shows how to create your own weights for tools or any object detection and classification

Step: 1
Create a folder with any name of your choice
TIP: dont put spaces between words instead use "_"

Step: 2
Create the dataset needed for training.
I personally prefer to use Roboflow as the User Interface helps to detect polygons automatically and hence reduces time to make the dataset.
Once dataset is created either you can download it or the Roboflows creates code to access in cloud.


Step: 3
